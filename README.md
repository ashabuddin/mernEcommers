Admin Panel
The admin panel view is meant to handle all the orders, products and registered users
An order can be marked as delivered, after the user has completed the payment
The admin can create a product for the shop, which makes it easier to add/remove more products to replicate a real world e-commerce site
The users detail can altered, only by setting them as admin or not. Other than this, the admin cannot change any other detail about the registered user.
Helps give an estimate of the total number of orders and users on the app.
Admin can make new admin and make admin to user.
